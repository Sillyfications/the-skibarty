Source code of Human Skibidi Toilet bot on Discord

You need to install python 3.12 or something, I forgot what the latest version was. You could've ran this via Replit, but they basically shot themselves in the foot with the new "deployments" system. (yes i was a freeloader shattap every bot hoster was)

You need to install discord.py and probably some other stuff I don't know.

This bot stores the following:
Image Links,

Upload Date

No userids are saved in the database.txt file.
Feel free to fork, not stopping ya.
